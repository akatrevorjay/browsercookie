Browser Cookie
==============

The **browser\_cookie** module loads cookies used by your web browser
into a cookiejar object. This can be useful if you want to use python to
download the same content you see in the web browser without needing to
login.

Install
-------

.. sourcecode:: bash

        pip install browser-cookie

Note only Python 2 is supported currently.

Usage
-----

Here is a hack to extract the title from a webpage:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import re
    >>> get_title = lambda html: re.findall('<title>(.*?)</title>', html, flags=re.DOTALL)[0].strip()

And here is the webpage title when downloaded normally:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import urllib2
    >>> url = 'https://bitbucket.org/'
    >>> public_html = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
    >>> get_title(public_html)
    'Git and Mercurial code management for teams'

Now let's try with **browser\_cookie** - make sure you are logged into
Bitbucket in Firefox before trying this example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import browser_cookie
    >>> cj = browser_cookie.firefox()
    >>> opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
    >>> login_html = opener.open(url).read()
    >>> get_title(login_html)
    'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'

You should see your own username here, meaning the module successfully
loaded the cookies from Firefox.

Here is an alternative example with
`requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`__, this time
loading the Chrome cookies. Again make sure you are logged into
Bitbucket in Chrome before running this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import requests
    >>> cj = browser_cookie.chrome()
    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cj)
    >>> get_title(r.content)
    'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'

Alternatively if you don't know/care which browser has the cookies you
want then all available browser cookies can be loaded:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    >>> cj = browser_cookie.load()
    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cj)
    >>> get_title(r.content)
    'richardpenman / home &mdash; Bitbucket'

Contribute
----------

So far the following platforms are supported:

-  **Chrome:** Linux, OSX
-  **Firefox:** Linux, OSX, Windows

However I only tested on a single version of each browser and so am not
sure if the cookie sqlite format changes location or format in
earlier/later versions. If you experience a problem please `open an
issue <https://bitbucket.org/richardpenman/browser_cookie/issues/new>`__
which includes details of the browser version and operating system. Also
patches to support other browsers are very welcome, particularly for
Chrome and Internet Explorer on Windows.
